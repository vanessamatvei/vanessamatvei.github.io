    <p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant advances in computer vision tasks, yet their high inference times and latency 
      often limit real-world applicability. While model compression techniques have gained popularity as solutions, they often overlook the critical 
      balance between low latency and uncompromised accuracy. By harnessing quantum-inspired pruning, tensor decomposition and annealing-based matrix
      factorization – three quantum-inspired concepts – we introduce QIANets: a novel approach of redesigning the traditional GoogLeNet, DenseNet, 
      and ResNet-18 model architectures to process more parameters and computations whilst maintaining low inference time.
