# My Personal Portfolio & Website

This is the official portfolio website of **Vanessa Matvei**.  
It showcases my journey as a researcher, creative thinker, and writer, with sections including:

- About – a personal introduction and story  
- Publications – highlights of my research and papers
- Essays – articles and reflections across science, ethics, and creativity  
- Gallery – selected works capturing my perspective on the world  
- Contact – ways to connect with me across platforms  

The site is designed as both a *personal archive* and a *professional presence*, reflecting my curiosity-driven approach to art, science, and technology.
