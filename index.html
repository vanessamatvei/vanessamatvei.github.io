          <p>I’ve always been pulled toward the places where worlds meet—where art, science, and technology cross paths to create something surprising. 
          For me, curiosity is the common thread. It’s Da Vinci’s <i>saper vedere</i> (“knowing how to see”), Ada Lovelace’s “poetical science,” and 
          Einstein’s claim that curiosity matters more than knowledge itself.</p>
        
          <p>I don’t believe in being just “specialized.” Everything connects if you look closely enough: 
          algorithms mirror nature’s patterns, creativity shapes mathematics, and history sparks innovation. 
          Tracing those threads is what my work revolves around—<u>creating my life’s web.</u></p>

          <p>Things that inspire me span both the whimsical and the infinite: classic Disney animations, the quiet stretch of a night sky, 
          the vastness of mountains, forests, and sea. I’m energized by movement and discipline in equal measure: running, swimming, and tennis keep me active, 
          while the works of Monet, Klimt, Van Gogh, and the artistry of code keep my mind engaged.</p>
        
          <p>As for what I’m chasing? Greatness in the sense of becoming the fullest, most curious version of myself. Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
